          <p className="text-base font-inter leading-relaxed text-[#D4D4D8]">
            The internet is a wild and blooming garden full of potential for creativity, connection and chaos. But beauty unchecked can grow over with ease. Every day, thousands of new links to non-consensual abuse material go live on the internet.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base font-inter leading-relaxed text-[#D4D4D8] mt-4">
            Most of this content doesn’t live on mainstream platforms. 85-90% of persistent NCSAM circulation is hosted on the same: a fragmented network of unindexable abusive forums, turn a repost pipeline: fake tube clones, offshore hosts, and aggregators.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base font-inter  leading-relaxed text-[#D4D4D8] mt-4">
            These sites are financially enabled by a complex web of ad networks, affiliate programs, and high-risk payment processors. Content is kept up for weeks, months, even years — often scabbed after takedown requests. There is often no clear standard for what action is required, or how quickly it should happen.

          <p className="text-base font-inter leading-relaxed text-[#D4D4D8]">
            Prune is changing the way consent is enforced online. We are designing the infrastructure that makes consent enforceable, enforceability affordable, and at scale.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base  font-inter  leading-relaxed text-[#D4D4D8] mt-4">
            First, we identify how harmful content is being more widely shared: through ad networks, content pipelines, affiliate schemes, and hosting infrastructure. Then we map the networks involved. If they’ll act, we escalate and partner with civil society.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base  font-inter  leading-relaxed text-[#D4D4D8] mt-4">
            And since companies are so ready to clean up their systems, we offer free tools to do it: lightweight, legal, and partly computer vision-based tooling that supports platforms and payment providers in reducing non-consensual content at scale — without burdening moderation teams or creating watch trails.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base  font-inter  leading-relaxed text-[#D4D4D8] mt-4">
            We don’t charge victims and we never will. Our work is funded by platforms that want to do it responsibly and by the legal consequences for those that don’t.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base  font-inter  leading-relaxed text-[#D4D4D8] mt-4">
            We can’t control everything that grows online - but we can choose what to cut back. Let’s work together to create new standards for consent in the digital age.
